# metrade
Metrade is an e-commerce platform specifically designed for the Metropolia community. Our mission is to provide a safe, convenient, and affordable way for students to buy and sell items on campus. With Metrade, students can easily access essentials like books, kitchenware, clothes, and small furniture using MetCoin, a currency exclusive to our university. Beyond just purchasing new items, Metrade promotes sustainability by enabling students to sell items they no longer need, fostering a more eco-friendly and resource-conscious campus.
